In conclusion, the application is functional and the core logic is sound â€“ the API endpoints correspond to the intended CRUD operations and use appropriate patterns on a basic level.
By refactoring to use built-in ASP.NET Core features (model binding, ActionResult helpers), you can simplify the code and make it more robust to bad input.
Adhering to common conventions (RESTful routes, proper status codes with location headers, layering the app with services) will make the code more maintainable and aligned with typical ASP.NET Core best practices.
Additionally, incorporating security (validation and optional auth) will prepare the app for production-readiness.
These changes will enhance the quality and maintainability of the application while ensuring it remains correct and reliable.
